## Usage

    Click the link below to navigate to the start page. On the landing page, click Get Started if you would like to add, view, delete, or begin taking notes! This will take you to a notes screen where your saved notes will be on the left side of your screen. 
    
    If you would like to create/add a note, click the designated spots to give your note a title and further descriptive text in the note text area. Both fields are required before you are able to save, and once you have filled in both areas, you will be able to use the save button on the top right of the screen. 
    
    If you would like to view your saved notes (not just see the title), click on the note you would like to view on the left side of the screen. 
    
    If you are done viewing a note and would like to add additional notes, click the plus sign to revert back to input fields. 
    
    Finally, if you would like to delete a note, use the red trash icon on the saved notes tab to do so.

    Please reach out to me with any issues and enjoy the benifits of feeling on top of things with your new Note Taker app!
